JavaScript Modularizer
======================

The program in this repository allows a single text file containing multiple JavaScript classes declared within an HTML document to be split into separate class files, which can then be downloaded as an archive file in TAR format.  It also allows the reverse, accepting as input a TAR file produced by the preceding process, which will then be recombined into a single HTML file.
